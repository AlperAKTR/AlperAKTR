# 👋 Hi there, I'm Alper!

Feel free to check my simple projects!  
👇

---

### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
Nowhere… I'm unemployed for the moment 😄

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
Python basics.  
(Still new… and constantly asking: “WHY doesn’t this work?”)

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
No one for now.  
Maybe someday… who knows? 😂

### 🤔 I’m looking for help with:
Everything.  
Seriously… *everything.*  
Sometimes even `print()` acts suspicious.

### 💬 Ask me about:
Don’t.  
I probably have **no idea** what you’re asking 😅  
But hey, I’ll try my best to learn.

### 📫 How to reach me:
**lutfualperakten@gmail.com**  
(…but why would you contact me though? xD)

### ⚡ Fun fact:
Sometimes my code runs without errors and I get scared:  
“How?? No error?? This must be a trap…”

Thanks for visiting!  
Don’t worry — someday I’ll be pro-level too…  
**…maybe…** 🤷‍♂️😄
